        <h1>My Resume</h1>
        <img src="./PFP.jpg" height="300">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
                Welcome to my Web Development Resume page, this is my first capstone 
                project which is here to showcase the html I have learnt so far. As 
                it is early in my learning it will be a simple site but I am looking 
                forward to updating it as and when I learn new skills.
        <h2>Education</h2>
            <p><ul>
                <li>NVQ level 2 in carpentry</li>
                <li>NVQ level 3 in carpenty</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>As a carpenter I have spent the last 8 years as the lead carpenter on
                a small construction company, Prior to this i was running my own 
                small carpentry company which mainly dealt in small to mid size projects 
                like kitchens but occasionally I would take on larger projects like 
                loft conversions.
            </p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>My current skills specific to programming at the moment are limited to 
                html but I am actively learning and hope to include CSS and Javascript
                soon.
                I beleive I also have developed many transferrable skills as a carpenter over the years as I 
                would have to meet clients in their own home to discuss their requirements, liase with them
                throughout the entire project from quote stage up to completion. This could mean spending 
                many months in their home and causing great disruption so I have developed great skills in 
                communication and setting expectations (for example, when fitting a kitchen you have to 
                emphasise just how disruptive it can be as not only will the work be dusty and there be no
                where for them to prepare food but also the new kitchen will often need to be stored in a 
                space thay would normally be used for other activities like the living room. As long as 
                you have communicated this clearly and they are prepared for it then there is far less 
                chance of the client getting frustrated). More job specific skills were collaberating with 
                other trades to keep the project on time (For example, Loft conversoins would require many
                trades from carpenters, roofers, plumbers, electricians, plasterers and decorators and I 
                would be the one to make sure they were scheduled in and the job was ready for when they 
                arrived), problem solving skills were regularly tested as you never know what you will be 
                uncovering when you start taking apart properties and an eye for detail as people demand 
                quality when they are spending their life savings on a project as large as a loft conversion 
                or a full kitchen refit.</p>
